## Contributing

If you want to help improve syntax highlighting, let @ballingt on the Endless Sky Discord know or make a pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/thomasballinger/endless-sky-vscode).

Syntax highlighting of keywords is based on the text files in the syntaxgen folder. If a word isn't being highlighted, adding it to on of these files should fix it.

Some features will be provided by an [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) using the [JavaScript Endless Sky bindings](https://github.com/thomasballinger/endless-sky-bindings). Contributions to these bindings are helpful too.
